# md2odt

#### A script to convert github flavoured markdown into ODT format

- this was required to submit coursework as a docx file, I open and check the ODT file in libreoffice before saving as a docx and submitting

- I created this because I always forget the command and it will presumably remain fairly constant

- you can do what you want with this
- thank pandoc, not me.
